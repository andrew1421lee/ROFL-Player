Hey! I just wanted to tell you that I think the program you made is awesome! 

I was just looking for something to open .rolf files and you helped me do much more. 
I don't know if you know but you can even save highlights by watching a replay with the program you wrote.

I do, however, have an observation I want to share with you. There is no .exe file to open once you download your project.
Meaning that I had to run your program once and then the .exe file was created. Only after that could I use it. :)
This could be an issue for people without an IDE to run your code. I guess you could include that in the readme file or something.

That's all I wanted to say. Have a nice day and thank you!
